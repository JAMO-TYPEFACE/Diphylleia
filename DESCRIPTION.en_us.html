    Diphylleia is a typeface based on the motif of the song "Diphylleia grayi" by singer Jonghyun of SHINee; designed to better convey his sentimental lyrics. The typeface was inspired by the affectionate expression of the song about how the flower becomes transparent and disappearing, and puts these impressions into the brush style strokes. Diphylleia grayi is a mysterious flower that gets transparent when the water touches its petals.

    JAMO is a type design collective group based in Seoul, Korea. We provide professional education, information, and discussion to designers who are wishing to develop their own typefaces through our workshop. JAMO encourages more experimental and unconventional typeface design by getting inspirations from old types, finding an alternative usage from existing ones, and suggesting new letterforms for the future. We aim to escape from the passive practice and create more self-initiating active typefaces. JAMO offers high-quality typeface design based on the deep levels of research, planning, and study. By broadening the potential of Hangul, we propose a new type design methodology to co-live with other worldwide letters including the Latin Alphabet.
