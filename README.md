Diphylleia(산하엽체) is a typeface based on the motif of the song 'Diphylleia grayi ' by singer Jonghyun of SHINee, designed to better convey his sentimental lyrics.
Designer was inspired by the affectionate expression of the song about how the flower becomes transparent and disappearing, and put these impressions into the brush style strokes.
Diphylleia grayi is a mysterious flower that gets transparent when the water touches its petals.
It has a strong image of returning without disappearing, rather than just a delicate flower that becomes transparent.
The soft but strong image of Diphylleia grayi is expressed with thin and omitted strokes and gradually thickening strokes.
It has a unique impression and can be used for display, but due to its softening curve, the overall atmosphere of the flower can be better felt when used in a long text.
